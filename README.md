CodeAlpha Task 4: Student Grade Tracker
    The Student Grade Tracker project is a Python application developed using the Tkinter library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Its primary purpose is to assist educators or administrators in managing student records and assessments within an educational institution. Here's a brief description of the project:

User Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface where users can perform various tasks such as adding, viewing, and deleting student records, as well as adding assessments for each student.

Functionality:

# Add Student Records: 
   Users can enter details such as student name, email, phone number, gender, date of birth, and section to add new student records to the system.
# View and Delete Records: 
   Users can view a list of existing student records and have the option to delete individual records as needed.
# Add Assessments: 
   Users can select a student and a course to add assessments for that student. Assessments include midterm, final, and assignment grades.
# Display Assessment Results: 
   After adding assessments, the application displays the assessment results, including grades, total marks, and whether the student passed or failed.
# Database Integration: 
  The application integrates with a SQLite database to store student records and assessment data. It utilizes SQL queries to perform operations such as inserting, deleting, and retrieving data from the database.

Error Handling: The project includes error handling mechanisms to validate user inputs and display appropriate error messages if any input is missing or invalid.

#Graphical Interface: Tkinter provides a visually appealing graphical interface with widgets such as labels, entry fields, buttons, and treeviews for displaying tabular data.

Overall, the Student Grade Tracker project offers a convenient and efficient solution for managing student records and assessments in an educational setting, helping educators track student progress and performance effectively.
